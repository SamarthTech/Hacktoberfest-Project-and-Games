# Spam-Ham-Email-Classifier
This can be used to filter spam emails from a number of emails. This has been done using basic knowledge of Python File Handling and does not involve any Machine Learning Algorithms.

##
## How to Install
          

1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ``` git clone https://github.com/SatyakiDey75/Spam-Ham-Email-Classifier ``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd Spam-Ham-Email-Classifier ``` 
4. Check the ``` requirements.txt ``` file once before running the program.
5. And now you are good to go :)

##
## Usage
- Copy the email id, header and content of the email you want to validate.
- To initiate the program, run ``` python3 Main.py```
- Now enter the details as asked by the program.
- The program will check the details and give you the result.

##
## FAQ
- How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac) 
- You get ``` PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ``` ? Close the csv files in the MS Excel app and try again.
- For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.
